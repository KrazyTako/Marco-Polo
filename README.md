# Marco-Polo

Fall 2017 Senior design competition app that my group and I made during our CS 472 class at UNLV.

Premise of the app was to make it easier for college students to have spontanious meet ups with other students on campus by sharing
your general location (either private or public) to all surrounding app users. When someone sees your 'Marco' they can choose to 'Polo' you
back. This will make it so that both of the users can see your exact location in real-time so that you can meet up.

You will need Android Studio to build.
Not sure how the app will behave as it has not been maintained and relies heavily on internet services such as Google Maps, Firebase Database,
Google auth and Facebook auth.

MarcoPoloApp/app/src/main/java/com/polo/marco/marcopoloapp/ has most of our actual source code.
